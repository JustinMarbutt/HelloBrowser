## Overview

A boilerplate for a HTML5 page to hack up, served on localhost, without lots of messy server stuff.

Using Grunt to run a small node server, along with the staple bower components, you are given all the tools you need to start haxzoring your way through a boring HTML5 page, and view the results in the browser.

## Requires Node!
